### Currency Convertor

## App purpose:

This app acts as a currency conversion calculator.
Unlike most currency convertor in the web, it allows a few key features:

-  Conversion from one currency to multiple other currencies.
-  Reverse conversion - from one of the selected currencies, to the rest.

I originally developed this app to help me with vacation planning abroad. When planning vacations, while searching the web for flight/hotel/attraction prices, we face many different currencies, which are different from our native coin.
This requires conversion from different currencies, which requires new tabs/switching the selected currencies.
This app allows you to select all the relevant currencies, and have them in one page, without the need to switch tabs every time.

## How to use:

1. Clone the git repository to your machine.
2. Open the terminal in the project's directory.
3. Install NodeJS.
4. Run yarn install/npm install in the terminal.
5. Depending on your OS:
   -  Linux/MacOS:
      -  Run npm/yarn start in the terminal
   -  Windows: 2 options
      -  Run npm/yarn start:windows in the terminal
      -  Open the file 'Run.cmd' which is located in the repository's root.
         -  Shortcuts of this file can be made.
